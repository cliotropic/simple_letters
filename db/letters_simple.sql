The main purpose of this step was to eliminate all reference to illegitimacy in the case of children born out of wedlock who are afterwards legitimized because of the marriage of their parents. Time and again the parents implore us to destroy any evidence of the fact that at the time their children were born they were illegitimate, but with the old form of certificate in use we could do nothing about it. The safeguarding of certificates from indiscriminate inspection does not solve the problem. As a matter of fact, our Department considers, and always has consirered, the records in its custody as confidential. Still, if at any time a complete transcript of a certificate is needed for a legitimate purpose, that transcript shows the facts as they were as the time the record was made. Do you not think that the prevention of tragedies which are likely to follow when a grown-up person discovers that he or she was illegitimate at the time of birth is of greater social value than statistics of illegitimacy?    \n\nI should certainly ve very glad to talk over with you in person the several phases of the problem....\"',NULL,3),

The recommendation that is made to eliminate item 7 from the standard birth registration form has one serious drawback, the complete eliminiation of statistics of illegitimate birhs. In spite of the obvious incompleteness of such registration at present, the fictures that are available are of great assistance in social planning for these children. Lack of such information in California and Massachusetts has always been a serious handicap. [OTOH,] what is gained by this plan? The report states that lack of information as to the fathers clearly indicates illegitimate birth even when item 7 is eliminated. I can not see therefore that elimination of this item and the statistical data obtained from it would add greatly to the welfare of individual children. The crux of the matter would seem to be as to what information in regard to these children should be made available to the general public in transcripts of birth records.   \n\nThere are htree groups of persons whose names as used in all social contacts are not the same as that which may be entered on their original birth certificates: Persons who have been legally adopted, persons of illegitimate birth whose names have been changed on legitimation through marriage of the parents, and persons who voluntarily have changed their legal name. To all of these groups it is a serious disadvantage to have any certification of age carrying a name which is not the one which is being used. In the past, because of the lesser use of proof of age in social contacts, this point has not been given serious consideration, but it is interesting to note that within the last few years 15 states have authorized a change of name on adoption. The need for such legislation is evident sinde from available figures for 10 states we estimate that about 18,000 children are adopted annually in the United States.\n\n[AKH argues based on numbers from MN that children born OOW, 45 percent of cases \"some change is required on the birth certificate.\"]\n\nI am fully in accord with the idea that no substitution should be made for the original record of birth. The file in the state office should show the original certificate with such changes as have been made officially. The real question is what should be given out. Certainly for proof of age purposes, the important thing is to issue the legal name of the person and the place and date of his birth. The question of transcripts is a different matter. There are 9 states ([KS, MA, MI, MN, NJ, TX, VA, WV, and WI]) which safeguard the child of illegitimate birth by requiring that no transcripts of such births shall be issued except to the person or his guardian or on court order. At least three of these states require that all illegitimate births must be kept in a special file, usually in the state office.    \n\nI realize that there must be serious mechanical problems entailed in making changes in birth records, but if the figures which I have given for children of illegitimate birth in Minnesota and for adoptions are applicable to the entire United States, it is evident that the names or family status are changed each year for about 10,000 children of legitimate birth and about 12,000 to 15,000 children of illegitimiate birth. This is a large enough problem so that serious consideration should be given to methods of meeting the problem.\n\nI agree with you fully that the child of illegitimate birth should not suffer because of his status. Careful planning for his care requires thorough knowledge and acceptance of his status, but every safeguard should be taken that this knowledge should be official and confidential. Frankly I think that elimination of item 7 on the birth certificate does not accomplish these two propositions. ...\"',NULL,3),

The problem entrusted to it presents two main phases: (1) the registration of children whose parents marry after the birth of the child, and (2) the registration of children whose parents do not marry each other.   The standard form of birth certificate calls for a statement regarding the legitimacy of the birth. If a child is born out of wedlock the quesiton relating to legitimacy is answered \"no\". According to the laws of most of the states a child born out of wedlock becomes legitimate if his parents subsequently marry each other. When evidence to this effect is submitted to the registration office, the usual procedure consists of crossing out \"no\" and inserting \"yes\". The certificate, however, still bears on its face the fact that the child, now legitimate, was born out of wedlock. Several states provide that in such cases new certificates may be filed in which the birth is entered as that of a legitimate child. The Committee questions the advisability of such a procedure since, from a strictly legal point of view, a certificate must show the facts as they are at the time of birth.\n\n[page 2]\nThis Committee recommends that the item relating to legitimacy be eliminated from the standard form of birth certificate since only in this way could the stigma of illegitimacy be removed from the child born out of wedlock who is later legitimized through the marriage of his parents. It may be added that no reference to legitimacy is contained in the birth certificates used by New York City and the states of California, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire. The Committee is not yet in position to make any definite statements regarding the wider aspects of the problem. According to the practice prevalent in this country, the name of the father of an illegitimate child may not be entered on the certificate without his consent. Therefore, a certificate in which the father\'s name is not given clearly indicates that the child is illegitimate. It is of interest ot note that at least in two states (Minnesota and Wisconsin), bureaus of the State government take measures to ascertain the paternity of children born out of wedlock, and when it is juridically established the name of the father is entered on the certificate even though the mother remains unmarried.    In its future activities the Committee will be guided by the concept which inspired the work of an earlier committee of the Section* — that no child born in this country should be handicapped because the circumstances of his birth are contrary to convention. [* See Report of Committee on Registration of Births of Illegitimate and Adopted Children, APHA Year Book, 1933-1934, pp 84-97.]\n\n[page 3]\n\nThis is the forthright position taken by the State of Arizona, whose statutes contain the clear-cut statement that \"every child is the legitimate child of its natural parents\"*.  \n\nIn the course of the coming year, the Committee will endeavor to formulate definite recommendations to be presented at the next annual meeting of the Association.\n\nJ.V.
