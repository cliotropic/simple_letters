README for simple_letters
=========================

This is a correspondence database I'm using for my dissertation on the history of birth certificates in the US.

Right now, all that's here is a current dump of a MySQL schema and its data, and my OpenOffice database frontend for it. I'm planning to write out more about what I'm doing later.
